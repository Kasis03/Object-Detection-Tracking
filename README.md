<h3><b>Problem Statement :</b></h3>
The problem at hand involves the development of efficient algorithms and methodologies capable of accurately identifying and continuously tracking objects in dynamic environments, in real-time.

<h3><b>Solution:</b></h3>
Computer Vison, our main objective was to identify objects passing through in real-timt. It count the number of people through the CCTV cameras present in the area. The camera is going to send the feed to our algorithm and the data is processed and classified by it. Once it detects a person it then sees if he has gone into the shop or not. This will help us make a count of all the people visiting.


<h3><b>Future Prospects:</b></h3>
This study and algorithm can be further applied to make a robust security system and prevent crimes in public areas. The applications are endless and the sky is the limit.

<h3><b>Tech Stack Used : </b></h3>

- Python [Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, ImageAI,Streamlit( for Webapp)]
